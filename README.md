# cs480_tsp

I believe that we should implement a quick and simple design for this project

Lets get the ability to parse the data and hold it into a data structure

Then lets develop an algorithm that links nodes together

Calculate the total distance between all the nodes

Then lets look at the 2 -opt swap for the optimization of the problem

Working on a display ability to show the algorithm working will help a lot

We will need to record the details and process and build a presentation
